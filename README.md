### Installing materials locally

We will provide a link to a Posit Cloud space for the workshop. However,
we recommend also installing the materials locally so you have two
options.

To install the required packages and course materials, we have an R
package called
{[causalworkshop](https://github.com/malcolmbarrett/causalworkshop)} to
help you do that! You can install
{[causalworkshop](https://github.com/malcolmbarrett/causalworkshop)}
from GitHub with:

``` r
install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("r-causal/causalworkshop")
```

Once youâ€™ve installed the package, install the workshop with

``` r
causalworkshop::install_workshop()
```

By default, this package downloads the materials to a conspicuous place
like your Desktop. You can also tell `install_workshop()` exactly where
to put the materials:

``` r
causalworkshop::install_workshop("a/path/on/your/computer")
```
