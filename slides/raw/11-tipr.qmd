## Recall: Propensity scores {background-color="#23373B"}

Rosenbaum and Rubin showed in observational studies, conditioning on **propensity scores** can lead to unbiased estimates of the exposure effect

::: nonincremental
1. **There are no unmeasured confounders**
2. Every subject has a nonzero probability of receiving either exposure

## Question

![](img/met-cancer.png)

## Analysis

* New-user design
* **Matched** 42,217 new metformin users to 42,217 new sulfonylurea users
* Fit **adjusted Cox proportional hazards model** on the matched cohort

## Results

* **Outcome:** Lung Cancer
* **Adjusted Hazard Ratio**: 0.87 (0.79, 0.96)

# What if **alcohol consumption** is an unmeasured confounder? {background-color="#23373B"}

# What if heavy alcohol consumption is prevalent among *4%* of Metformin users and *6%* of Sulfonylurea users?

*What if we assume the effect of alcohol consumption on lung cancer after adjusting for other confounders is 2?*

#| eval: false
#| code-line-numbers: '6'

# “If heavy alcohol consumption differed between groups, with *4%* prevalence among metformin users and *6%* among sulfonylureas users, and had an HR of *2* with lung cancer incidence the updated adjusted effect of metformin on lung cancer incidence would be an HR of *0.89 (95% CI: 0.81–0.98)*. Should an unmeasured confounder like this exist, our effect of metformin on lung cancer incidence would be attenuated and fall much closer to the null. {.tiny}

# “If heavy alcohol consumption differed between groups, with *4%* prevalence among metformin users and *6%* among sulfonylureas users, it would need to have an association with lung cancer incidence of *3.27 to tip this analysis* at the 5% level, rendering it inconclusive.

### Use the `tip_coef()` function to conduct a sensitivity analysis for the estimate from your previous exercises. Use the lower bound of the confidence interval for the effect and `0.1` for the exposure-confounder effect.
