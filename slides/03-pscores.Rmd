## Propensity scores

Rosenbaum and Rubin showed in observational studies, conditioning on **propensity scores** can lead to unbiased estimates of the exposure effect

1. There are no unmeasured confounders
2. Every subject has a nonzero probability of receiving either exposure

---

## Propensity scores

* Fit a **logistic regression** predicting exposure using known covariates

$$Pr(exposure = 1) = \frac{1}{1+\exp(-X\beta)}$$

* Each individuals' predicted values are the **propensity scores**

## Your turn

`r countdown::countdown(minutes = 10)`

1. Using the **confounders** identified in the previous DAG, fit a propensity score model for `qsmk`
2. Stretch: Create two histograms, one of the propensity scores for those that quit smoking and one for those that do not
