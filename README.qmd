### Installing materials locally

We will provide a link to a Posit Cloud space for the workshop. However, we recommend also installing the materials locally so you have two options.

To install the required packages and course materials, we have an R package called {[causalworkshop](https://github.com/malcolmbarrett/causalworkshop)} to help you do that! You can install {[causalworkshop](https://github.com/malcolmbarrett/causalworkshop)} from GitHub with:

``` r
install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("r-causal/causalworkshop")
```

Once you've installed the package, install the workshop with

``` r
causalworkshop::install_workshop()
```

By default, this package downloads the materials to a conspicuous place like your Desktop. You can also tell `install_workshop()` exactly where to put the materials:

``` r
causalworkshop::install_workshop("a/path/on/your/computer")
```
